# Analysing-Corpus-Callosum-Atrophy-in-Traumatic-Brain-Injury-Patients

The primary purpose of this study was to understand the effect certain variables had on the corpus callosum’s rate of atrophy in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) 
patients. In order to make accurate interpretations on variable eﬀects, an investigation was made obtaining a model that best ﬁt the data provided. Given the 
nature of this study, being exploratory rather than predictive, there was less focus on the predictive power of model(s). A mixed model was found, such that 
the ﬁxed and random eﬀects explained for approximately 78% of the total variation in the data (conditional R 2 ); 16% of which was explained by the ﬁxed eﬀect 
model (marginal R 2 ). Time was found to be highly signiﬁcant in the rate of atrophy (p-value ≤ 0.05). The rate of atrophy between the control and patient 
group was found to be statistically insigniﬁcant for the ﬁrst 925 days post injury. After such period, the patient group rate of atrophy/volume loss was found 
to be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than the control group. On day 925, a unit change in the group variable (control [0] to patient [1]) resulted in a decrease in the 
expected total volume of the corpus callosum by a factor of approximately 92.107 units. By day 2000, this decrease became a factor of approximately 180.48 
units. The overall eﬀect of sex was found to be statistically insigniﬁcant (p-value = 0.092) in the model. However, it was observed that the sexes had 
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in expected volume loss after day 416. The age group an individual belonged to was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant in the 
model (p-value negligible to 0.05). Belonging in the 19–33-year-old age group decreased the expected volume of the corpus callosum by a factor of approximately
123.21 units and belonging in the 65-78-year-old age group, by a factor of approximately 146.27 units. All in all, the model and results obtained in this study
were found to be both signiﬁcant and insightful with respect to the understanding of the variables’ eﬀects on corpus callosum atrophy.
